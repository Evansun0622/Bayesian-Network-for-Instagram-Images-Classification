# Photo-Classifier
In this project, we are working with instagram photos of five national parks. The task is to train up a classifier that correctly predicts the park from a photo. Our task is to train a prediction model which takes distilled representation of the photos, 1000 features from AlexNet, and predicts where the photo was taken.
